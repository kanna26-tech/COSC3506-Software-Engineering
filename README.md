## Description
 
Design an office messaging system, like a compact messenger system, which will allow staff members to send messages to each other that can be retained, deleted, archived, and organized by both the sender and receiver. The system can function on a peer-to-peer basis, or through a centralized message server. It will utilize the office LAN â€“ ensuring that messages do not leave the office environment. Individuals can be assigned to one or more groups, allowing messages to be sent to a single individual, several individuals, one or more groups, or broadcast to the entire office.
